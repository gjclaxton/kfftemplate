## Summary of Project

Describe the project, including the overall approach, data, and any special issues or observations that you feel a reviewer needs to understand. 

Split your work into chunks with a brief text description of the step and any important information preceeding each chunk. 

### Load libraries and data

```{r load data, echo=TRUE}
# Library(survey)
# library(openxlsx)
# options(scipen = 99)
# 
# Load data
# pathway to data

# Loading functions
# source(pathway to functions)

# if not an r project, what is the working directory

```

### Transform variables 

Brief comment

```{r transform variables, echo=TRUE}

# variable transformations


```

### Analysis

From here the type of analysis will determine how many steps and how to break them up

Describe each step in text before the chunk

### Save findings

Brief description of what is being saved and where

```{r}
# save a list of table objects to separate xlsx sheets
# tables_list <- list("sheetname" = table1, "sheet2name" = table2)

# save to spreadsheet with data and time in name, each table as a separate tab
# openxlsx::write.xlsx(tables_list, 
#     file = paste(format(Sys.time(), '%Y_%m_%d %H_%M'), "filename.xlsx", sep = "_"))


```
